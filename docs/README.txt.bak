# Sorana - The AI Visual Workspace

Sorana provides an intelligent, visual environment where your data is understood, organized, and actionable. It combines spatial AI organization with no-code agent orchestration to bring clarity and automation to your digital projects. Interact with your documents, visualize folder structures, and build intelligent workflows without writing code.

### Key Features

- **Spatial AI Organization**: Sorana uses AI to semantically group your assets and arranges them on an intelligent 2D canvas, providing an intuitive, bird's-eye view of your projects.
- **WYSIWYG Canvas Editor**: Directly manipulate your workspace. Drag and drop files between groups, create new categories on the fly, rename items, and resize group boundaries with intuitive mouse controls.
- **Advanced Model Management**: Connect to multiple cloud and local LLM backends including OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama, Lemonade, Llamacpp, and other compatible services. The model manager lists all available models and allows users to activate or deactivate models as needed for specific tasks.

- **Multi-Service AI Integration**: Sorana supports seamless connection to both local and cloud-based AI services:
  - **Local Services**: Ollama, Llamacpp, and other self-hosted LLM solutions
  - **Cloud Services**: OpenAI, Mistral, Lemonade, and other cloud-based AI platforms
  - **Flexible Configuration**: Easily switch between different AI backends based on your needs, privacy requirements, and performance considerations
- **No-Code Agent Orchestration**: Build custom agents and connect them into intelligent pipelines using a simple drag-and-drop interface. Agents collaborate by passing insights from one to another to solve complex problems, all without writing code.
- **Contextual Document Chat**: Interact directly with your files (PDFs, code, text) in interactive mode, and enhance agent capabilities by connecting relevant documents to their context.
- **Dynamic Structure Mapping**: Visualize the big picture. Generate mind maps of your folder hierarchies to reveal relationships and structure.
- **Private & Portable**: Run AI models locally (Llama, Ollama) or connect to the cloud. Sorana is fully portable and designed to keep your data under your control.
