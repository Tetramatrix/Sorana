# Sorana - The AI Visual Workspace

Sorana is an AI-powered visual workspace that transforms how you organize and interact with digital files. Using semantic AI analysis, it automatically groups related files and folders onto a spatial 2D canvas, replacing traditional hierarchies with intuitive visual layouts. Build drag-and-drop workspaces and no-code agent pipelines, connect to on-prem or cloud AI backends (OpenAI, Mistral, Lemonade, Ollama), and keep your data under your control.

### Key Features

- **Spatial AI Organization**: Uses AI to semantically group files and arrange them on a 2D canvas, providing a visual overview of projects.
- **WYSIWYG Canvas Editor**: Direct manipulation of workspace elements. Drag and drop files between groups, create new categories, rename items, and adjust group boundaries.
- **Advanced Model Management**: Connect to multiple cloud and on-prem LLM backends including OpenAI, Mistral, Ollama, Lemonade, Llamacpp, and other compatible services. The model manager lists all available models and allows users to activate or deactivate models as needed for specific tasks.

- **Multi-Service AI Integration**: Sorana supports seamless connection to both on-prem and cloud-based AI services:
  - **On-Prem Services**: Ollama, Llamacpp, and other self-hosted LLM solutions
  - **Cloud Services**: OpenAI, Mistral, Lemonade, and other cloud-based AI platforms
  - **Flexible Configuration**: Easily switch between different AI backends based on your needs, privacy requirements, and performance considerations
- **No-Code Agent Orchestration**: Build custom agents and connect them into intelligent pipelines using a simple drag-and-drop interface. Agents collaborate by passing insights from one to another to solve complex problems, all without writing code.
- **Contextual Document Chat**: Interact directly with your files (PDFs, code, text) in interactive mode, and enhance agent capabilities by connecting relevant documents to their context.
- **Dynamic Structure Mapping**: Visualize the big picture. Generate mind maps of your folder hierarchies to reveal relationships and structure.
- **Portable**: The application is portable and keeps data under user control.

### Quick Start

- Download the portable archive, extract anywhere, and run Sorana.exe.
- Optional: Open the settings to configure AI models and workspace preferences.

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 11 (64-bit)
- **AI Support**: Built-in models or on-prem/remote AI services
- **RAM**: Minimum 4 GB
- **Storage**: Minimum 2 GB (application + model)
- **Permissions**: Standard user account

### Visual Workspace Features

- **Spatial AI Organization**: AI automatically groups and arranges files on a 2D canvas for intuitive project visualization
- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag and drop files, create categories, rename items, and adjust group boundaries directly on the canvas
- **Visual Connections**: Create connections between agents and documents using visual arrows and interfaces
- **Mind Map Generation**: Generate visual representations of folder hierarchies to understand relationships and structure

### AI Model Configuration

- **Built-in Models**: The built-in model (~806MB) is downloaded on first run and works fully offline. It is fast, but may sometimes classify complex files as "Miscellaneous".
- **Performance Notes**: From 8b parameters, decent results can be expected; Llama 3.1 8b Instruct is recommended
- **Accuracy Considerations**: May sometimes classify complex files as "Miscellaneous"; connect larger, on-prem or cloud models for improved accuracy
- **Processing Time**: Varies based on folder size and available hardware

### Connecting Agents

To connect agents in Sorana:
- Hold **CTRL+ALT** and click on an Agent title to get a green arrow
- Point the green arrow to the parent agent to establish the connection
- In the child Agent configuration, enable 'Auto' (puts agent in orchestration mode to receive instructions from parent agent) and 'Passthrough' (allows the agent to also pass documents).
- This creates a pipeline where agents can pass insights and collaborate on complex tasks
